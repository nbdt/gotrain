/*
Implementation of stacked restricted boltzmann machines.

Constrastive Divergence (CD)

Recommendation to start with 1 round CD and increase as learning slows. EX:
CD1 ==> CD3 ==> CD5 ==> ... ==> learned weights

Modeling with real-valued data.
Visible units: linear with gaussian noise
Hidden units:  rectified linear units

Alternativly can use mean-feild approximation (0 - 255 pixel represents probabilty of pixel being on)

Fine tuning to improve generation:
1. Do a stochastic bottom-up pass
 -- adjust top-down weights of lower layers
2. Do a few iterations of sampling in the top level RBM
 -- do CD learning to update weights of top level RMB
3. Do a stochastic top-down pass
 -- adjust bottom-up weights
